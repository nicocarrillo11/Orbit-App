# Orbit 💿
### A Modern Art Gallery for Your Life.

Orbit is an anti-brain-rot social ecosystem built on intentionality and the 24-hour cycle.

## Core Philosophies
- **The Core:** 16 memory slots. To add a new one, you must eject an old one.
- **The 24h Decay:** Posts in The Orbit last 24 hours. No archives, no loitering.
- **Gravity Snap:** Once you finish your daily loop, you are pulled back to your Surface.
- **The Single Ping:** You get one signal per day. Spend it wisely.

## Tech Stack
- React + Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (Gravity Snap & Animations)
- Lucide React (Minimalist Iconography)
